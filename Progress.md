9/03: Setup, research, & start learning Manim - Start work on intializing core functions
9/05: Start & finish scene 1
9/09: Worked on code format - touching up core functions & scene 1 - start on scene 2 with working on brining matrix to center
9/10: Finished scene 2 on bringing matrix to center - start on scene 3 to visualize the Fox algroithim for each rows - work on exendibilty of the matrices to fit the algroithm 
9/19: Work on exendibility of the matrices to fit the algorithm - First Row now visualizes step 1 of Fox Algorithim no matter the row and column count - Started work on the visualizing rest of the rows
