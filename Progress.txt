9/03: Setup, research, & start learning Manim - Start work on intializing core functions
9/05: Start & finish scene 1
9/09: Worked on code format - touching up core functions & scene 1 - start on scene 2 with working on brining matrix to center
9/10: Finished scene 2 on bringing matrix to center - start on scene 3 to visualize the Fox algroithim for each rows - work on exendibilty of the matrices to fit the algroithm 
9/19 (Morning): Work on exendibility of the matrices to fit the algorithm - First Row now visualizes step 1 of Fox Algorithim no matter the row and column count - Started work on the visualizing rest of the rows
9/19 (Afternoon/Night): Work on exendibility of the matrices to fit the algorithm - Rest of the rows, except last row, no visualizes step 1 of the Fox Algorithim no matter the row and column count
9/20: Finished scene 3 - Last row no visualizes step 1 of the fox algorithm with exendibility in mind - Proofread/edited comments & code for understanding
9/24: Reorganize files & for accessibility and organization - start work on scene 4 with updating entries by their product from entry B and entry A from scene 3. Left off with needing to properly animate the fade out all values
