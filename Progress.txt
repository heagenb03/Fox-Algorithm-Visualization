9/03: Setup, research, & start learning Manim - Start work on intializing core functions
9/05: Start & finish scene 1
9/09: Worked on code format - touching up core functions & scene 1 - start on scene 2 with working on brining matrix to center
9/10: Finished scene 2 on bringing matrix to center - start on scene 3 to visualize the Fox algroithim for each rows - work on exendibilty of the matrices to fit the algroithm 
9/19 (Morning): Work on exendibility of the matrices to fit the algorithm - First Row now visualizes step 1 of Fox Algorithim no matter the row and column count - Started work on the visualizing rest of the rows
9/19 (Afternoon/Night): Work on exendibility of the matrices to fit the algorithm - Rest of the rows, except last row, no visualizes step 1 of the Fox Algorithim no matter the row and column count
9/20: Finished scene 3 - Last row no visualizes step 1 of the fox algorithm with exendibility in mind - Proofread/edited comments & code for understanding
9/24: Reorganize files & for accessibility and organization - start work on scene 4 with updating entries by their product from entry B and entry A from scene 3. Left off with needing to properly animate the fade out all values 
9/26: Edit previous code for readibility & accessibility - finished animation for updating Cij values - start and finish work on updating entry Bij values to move up row 
9/27: Fix up previous animation errors - Organize large chunks of code into functions for accessibility - Brainstorm the movement of Aij values for reach row after first time
10/03: Organize functions into apporiate classes for reuse - Debug issues related to creation of new classes/functions - Continue brainstorm/experimetning movement of Aij values for each row - Most likely have to redo functions that move Aij values as they are to hardcoded to work only for the first iteration
10/04: Continue work on the movement of Aij for each rows 
10/05: Continue brainstorm the movement of Aij rows and update the VGroup of matrices - figure out key points of error and rewrite of code to address it and find altneratives
10/17: Continue previous work
10/19: "Restarted" work - created new folder as attempt two as attempt 1 was getting too "junky" - Work on copying old code to new files as well as debugging old code - Worked on the movemeant of Aij for each rows 
10/22: Make progress on the movement of Aij rows - experiment and work on integrating NumPy arrays to the matrices - Aij values that shift across the row towards the right now move when needed
10/23: Finish the movemeant of Aij rows - work on updating the computed C values
